## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r distribution probasbility function}

f <- function(x) {
  return(12 * exp(-abs(x)))
}

metropolis <- function(N, initial_x, s) {
  # Initialize variables
  x <- numeric(N)
  x[1] <- initial_x
  
  # Run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
  for (i in 2:N) {
    # Propose a new sample from the Normal distribution
    randomXStar <- rnorm(1, mean = x[i - 1], sd = s)
    
    # Compute the acceptance ratio
    ratio <- f(randomXStar) / f(x[i - 1])
    
    # Generate a random number from the uniform distribution
    u <- log(runif(1))
    
    # Update the sample based on the log acceptance ratio
    if (u < log(ratio)) {
      x[i] <- randomXStar
    } else {
      x[i] <- x[i - 1]
    }
  }
  
  return(x)
}


set.seed(123)

# Parameters
N <- 10000  # Number of iterations
initial_x <- 0  # Initial value
s <- 1  # Standard deviation for the proposal distribution

# Run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
generated_samples <- metropolis(N, initial_x, s)

# Plot histogram and kernel density plot
hist(generated_samples, breaks = 30, prob = TRUE, col = "skyblue", main = "Metropolis-Hastings Samples", xlab = "x")
lines(density(generated_samples), col = "purple", lwd = 2)

# Overlay true distribution
curve(f(x), add = TRUE, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Report sample mean and standard deviation
mean_generated <- mean(generated_samples)
sd_generated <- sd(generated_samples)

cat("Sample Mean:", mean_generated, "\n")
cat("Sample Standard Deviation:", sd_generated, "\n")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{For Q1b}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
